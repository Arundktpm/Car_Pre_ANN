# Car_Sales_price-pridiction using ANN
# Overview
In this project, we utilize machine learning techniques, specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), to predict car sales prices. The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of historical car sales data, including features like mileage, brand, year of manufacture, etc., along with the corresponding sale prices.
# Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. TensorFlow
3. NumPy
4. Pandas
5. Matplotlib
6. Scikit-learn
7. seaborn
# To run the provided Python code step by step, follow these instructions:
# Install Required Libraries:
*Before running the code, ensure that you have installed the required libraries. You can install them using pip, if you haven't already:
# CMD Command:
* pip install numpy pandas matplotlib plotly scikit-learn tensorflow
# Prepare Data:
*Make sure you have the dataset file "car_purchasing_data.csv" located at the correct path specified in the code  like ("/content/sample_data/car_purchasing_data.csv"). If the dataset is in a different location or has a different name, adjust the file path accordingly.

# Run the Code:
*Open a Python environment (IDE, Jupyter Notebook, or any Python interpreter) and copy the provided code into a Python script or a Jupyter Notebook cell.

# Execute the Code: 
*Run the code. This will execute each line of code sequentially.
